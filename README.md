# SAIT Assessment

Hello,

Here you will find my attempt at the assessment questions sent to me on the 22nd of June.

In an effort to have as little backend work as possible for these, the questions are being resolved in pure JavaScript.


## Question 1
The data provide in the assessment was placed into an object array for further processing, in a real world scenario this
would probalby come in as s JSON stream so this should simulate that adequately.

## Question 2
As I could not clearly understand the desired math with repect to the vacation and holiday days, i have not accounted 
for those in the calculations.  The math is easy enough, however its use in the question was not clear.

I have used vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap for a "cleaner" UI in this question.  As well validation is being left up 
to the browser.  The script code does not perform any validation on its side and presumes all data coming in is sane 
(as validated on the browser end).  If compatibility with older browsers were needed the data validation could be 
implemented in the code obviously, however I felt in this instance that would be more work than necessary for an 
assessment.

## Question 3
I have not had enough time to play with this as I could not get to the assessment until late iin the day.  I will 
endeavour to finish this tomorrow morning.
